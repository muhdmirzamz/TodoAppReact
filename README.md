## Todo App React

A todo app with a React frontend and Express.js backend. It uses the Firebase real-time database and is planned to be hosted on Heroku. 

This is used in conjunction with an [iOS todo app](https://github.com/muhdmirzamz/TodoApp) I'm working on. Both of these projects connect to the same Firebase database.
